# Staging space configuration

## General

vProtect node needs staging space available in `/vprotect_data` by default. It is common to use PowerProtect DD for both the staging and backup destination. This will result in instant "store" processing, without the need to copy data from the staging space to the backup destinations. 
It is common to just attach an empty drive and mount it.

When using separate storage \(usually local disks\) for the staging space, please consider its requirements. Staging space size depends on the number and size of simultaneous backups - as a rule of a thumb make it approximately equal to the number of expected simultaneous backup threads multiplied by the size of your biggest VM.

In any case - make sure the staging space is always mounted in the `/vprotect_data` folder, and that the vprotect user is able to have full permissions to this file system.

### Example - Local filesystem

You also can use a plain file system for staging space \(and optionally for backup destination\). Here are steps assuming you have a local \(physical or virtual\) disk.

* List all existing disks, and find your dedicated disk \(let's say - `/dev/sdc`\):

  ```text
     [root@vProtect01 ~]# fdisk -l | grep dev
     Disk /dev/sda: 32.2 GB, 32212254720 bytes, 62914560 sectors
     /dev/sda1   *        2048     1026047      512000   83  Linux
     /dev/sda2         1026048    62914559    30944256   8e  Linux LVM
     Disk /dev/sdc: 500 GB, 17179869184 bytes, 33554432 sectors
     Disk /dev/sdb: 21.5 GB, 21474836480 bytes, 41943040 sectors
     Disk /dev/mapper/centos-root: 28.5 GB, 28462546944 bytes, 55590912 sectors
     Disk /dev/mapper/centos-swap: 3221 MB, 3221225472 bytes, 6291456 sectors
  ```

* If you have a new clean disk prepare a filesystem on it:

  ```text
  mkfs.xfs -K /dev/sdc
  ```

* Test mount your existing filesystem in the created directory:

  ```text
  mount /dev/sdc /vprotect_data
  ```

* Set ownership to `vprotect` user on directory `/vprotect_data`:

  ```text
  chown vprotect:vprotect -R /vprotect_data
  ```

* Add a line to `/etc/fstab` file, to automatically mount new filesystem after reboot:

  ```text
  /dev/sdc    /vprotect_data    xfs    defaults 0 0
  ```

* Mount

  ```text
  mount -a
  ```

* Confirm with `df` that your `/vprotect_data` is mounted
* Restart your `vprotect-node` service:

  ```text
  systemctl restart vprotect-node
  ```

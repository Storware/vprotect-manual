# LVM setup on vProtect Node for disk attachment backup mode

**Note:** this is required for **Nutanix** and **RHV v4 API** \(when using disk attachment mode\)

vProtect Node attaches VM disks that potentially are clones of its own \(i.e. if Node deployed from the template\) - you need to configure LVM on the Node so that it doesn't scan for LVM volumes where disks are being attached.

1. Set the following variables in `/etc/lvm/lvm.conf` - so that only system volumes are being detected by LVM daemon \(in this example `/dev/sda1`\):

   ```text
   filter = [ "a|^/dev/sda1$|", "r|.*|" ]
   global_filter = [ "a|^/dev/sda1$|", "r|.*|" ]
   ```

2. Check with `vgscan -vvv` that your OS volumes are still being detected:

   ```text
        Allocated VG vg_vprotect at 0x55914f19fac0.
        Importing logical volume vg_vprotect/lv_root.
        Importing logical volume vg_vprotect/lv_swap.
   ```

3. Reboot:

   ```text
   reboot
   ```

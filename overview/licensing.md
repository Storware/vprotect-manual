# Licensing

We offer several licensing options, which allows you to choose the best fit for the use you require.

**Note:** Licensing options cannot be mixed within a single environment.

## Types

### Per Host

This license type covers the number of physical hosts under virtualization technology. With per-host licensing you can have an unlimited number of VMs or TBs. If you have machines with more than 2 sockets, then you need one host license per every two sockets. This is the most commonly chosen option as future host growth is more predictable, and you do not need to take care of the dynamically changing number of VMs or TBs used.

### Per VM

This license type covers the exact number of virtual machines that you want to protect. You can have any number of hosts or TBs. This option is a good fit for MSPs so as to align with your managed VM services pricing.

### Per TB

Here we meet requirements for aligning with front-end TB licensing. In 1TB steps, only the size of your storage being backed up matters. You can have as many hosts or VMs as you want. In some cases, this is the most effective license option, especially for smaller numbers of TBs.

### Per Compute Node

Here we have a special option for our [Kubernetes](../deployment/protected-platforms/containers/kubernetes.md) or [Red Hat OpenShift](../deployment/protected-platforms/containers/red-hat-openshift.md) containerization platforms.

## Storage List

To perform on-demand backup, go to the instances tab under the Storage Providers section.

You can click on the ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/icon-backup.jpg) icon to back up a single storage instance

Or select multiple instances and click on the ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/icon-backup2.jpg) icon to back them up.

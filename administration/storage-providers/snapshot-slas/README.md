# Snapshot SLAs

vProtect can periodically create snapshots and keep several of them for every storage instance. Currently it is supported only for Ceph RBD.

**Note:** Snapshot management for on-demand or scheduled operations is not available until the storage instance has a snapshot management policy assigned to it.

# Notification Rules

## General

vProtect allows a Notification Rules feature to create a semi-custom rule that will send notification triggered by an event specified in rule.   
 Go to Settings on a left menu and then click on Notification Rules button.

Fill in a name for your rule, set your notification to active and add one or more conditions from a list.

 Click **Add Action** button, choose **Action Type** from a list, add one or more recipients passing their email addresses.

After an event that will trigger notification, all recipients who have been added to notification rule will receive an email notification.

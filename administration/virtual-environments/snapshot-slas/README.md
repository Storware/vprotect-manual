# Snapshot SLAs

vProtect can periodically create snapshots and keep several of them for every VM. To see which hypervisor support this feature please go to [vProtect Support Matrix](./).

**Note:** Snapshot management for on-demand or scheduled operations is not available until the virtual machine has a snapshot management policy assigned to it.

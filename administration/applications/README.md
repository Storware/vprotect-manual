# Applications

vProtect allows you to set up periodic backup with your own scripts or application-native backup commands. These can be executed either on the Node or remotely over SSH. The application can reside anywhere - it can be in a VM, Kubernetes deployment or in a physical box. The only requirement is to allow vProtect to execute a set of commands over SSH or on the node to access data remotely.

# Execution Configurations

From this tab, you can create a command execution configuration, i.e. commands executed for the proper backup of your application \(or directed to the script file\).

![](../../.gitbook/assets/applications-execution-configurations.jpg)

1. Prepare script or commands and \(if remote SSH execution is required\) put them on the remote machine with your application
2. In the Applications section create a new **Command Execution Configuration**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/applications-execution-configurations-create-command.jpg)

This is a description of how your script is going to be invoked - you need to specify:

* **Command arguments** \(first one is the actual executable\) - all arguments should be provided separately - vProtect assumes that they can contain spaces
* **CMD execution method** - either on the Node or a command to be executed remotely
* select existing **Applications** \(or skip that for now - it can be assigned later\)
* **Export data** - this switch allows you to export \(or not\) data that will be generated by the command \(sometimes you may wish vProtect just to execute commands without transferring anything\)
* **Source type** \(if you export data\)
  * **FILE** - select if your command produces a single file/directory \(or multiple files\) - if you provide a directory or path with wildcards, vProtect will create a TAR archive - you have to specify **Source Path** for this source type
  * **STREAM** - select if your command generates backup to the standard output
* **Timeout** - for script/command execution - make sure to have this timeout set to the value high enough to allow your command to complete its execution
* Optionally you can define **environment variables** that you'll later be able to use in your commands/scripts. Note, that the variable name should not contain white-space characters.\*\*

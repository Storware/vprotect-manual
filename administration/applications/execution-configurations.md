# Execution Configurations

Using this tab, you can create a command execution configuration, i.e. commands executed for the proper backup of your application \(or directed to the script file\).

![](../../.gitbook/assets/applications-execution-configurations.jpg)

1. Prepare the script or commands, and \(if remote SSH execution is required\) put them on the remote machine with your application.
2. In the Applications section, create a new **Command Execution Configuration.**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/applications-execution-configurations-create-command.jpg)

This is a description of how your script is going to be invoked - you need to specify:

* **Command arguments** \(the first one is the actual executable\) - all arguments should be provided separately - vProtect assumes that they can contain spaces.
* **CMD execution method** - either on the Node or a command to be executed remotely.
* Select existing **Applications** \(or skip this for now - it can be assigned later\).
* **Export data** - this switch allows you to export \(or not\) data that will be generated by the command \(sometimes you may want vProtect just to execute commands without transferring anything\).
* **Source type** \(if you export data\)
  * **FILE** - select if your command produces a single file/directory \(or multiple files\) - if you provide a directory or path with wildcards, vProtect will create a TAR archive - you have to specify the **Source Path** for this source type.
  * **STREAM** - select if your command generates backup to the standard output.
* **Timeout** - for script/command execution - make sure to have this timeout set to a value high enough to allow your command to complete its execution.
* Optionally, you can define the **environment variables** that you'll later be able to use in your commands/scripts. Note that the variable name should not contain white-space characters.\*\*
